# PS 13: Investing for Everyone

## A Micro-Investment Platform for First-Time Users

### Problem Statement

A significant portion of India's population—especially individuals from rural, semi-urban, and low-income communities—remains excluded from formal investing. Common barriers include:

- Fear that investing is risky or meant only for the wealthy
- Lack of financial literacy and difficulty understanding jargon
- Distrust in existing financial applications
- Limited access to high-end smartphones or stable internet
- Perception that investing requires large amounts of money

As a result, millions of people rely solely on cash savings or informal methods, missing opportunities for safe wealth creation and financial security.

There is a strong need for a simple, transparent, and trustworthy micro-investment platform that allows first-time users to begin investing with very small amounts (as low as ₹10) in safe, low-risk financial instruments, without fear or confusion.

### Objective

Design and build a user-first micro-investment solution that:

- **Enables first-time users to invest with minimal amounts** (starting from ₹10)
- **Focuses on safe and low-risk investment options** (government bonds, fixed deposits, mutual funds)
- **Educates users without overwhelming them** (simple language, visual guides, bite-sized lessons)
- **Works effectively on low-end smartphones and limited connectivity** (lightweight app, offline features)
